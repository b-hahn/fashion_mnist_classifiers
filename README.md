# fashion_mnist_classifiers

This repo contains code to train four different neural network architectures for the purposes of classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset. To get started, install pytorch, torchvision and wandb. Then, simple specify the desired networks in the main function in train.py and run the file. Training progress is logged using wandb by default - if this isn't desired, run 'wandb off' in the console prior to training.
